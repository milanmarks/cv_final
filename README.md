# Compter Vision final project
This is a repository for my computer vision final project, which construct a hybrid ViT and compare it with the same_number_of_parameters model, resnet40, which modified from resnet34, and the same_number_of_FLOPs model, resnet71, which modified from resnet50.

The project is done on google colab. click the link to open the notebook.
